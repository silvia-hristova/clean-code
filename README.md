# clean-code
A project made for the game development course. 
It is a game where there are dragons falling from the sky and heroes that shoot them.
The screen is split in half and there are 2 players. The one with more points in the end wins.
Each player has 3 lives and if a dragon reaches the ground a life is taken from the hero.
